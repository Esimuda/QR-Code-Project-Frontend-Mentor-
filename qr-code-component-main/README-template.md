## My process

1. I used html to create the markup for the code, segregating them into paragraphs and divs.
2. I then used css to design it as required.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt the basics of css andd html. This includes the proper use of relative path of images and the use of margins and padding.

I will likely in the future improve on the code and use scss in this. I also inted to understand the use of CSS variables and implement them in later projects.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you Frontend Mentor for this project. I had fun.
